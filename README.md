# Graph-Traversal
Generates a PDF of graph fed to program through standard input.  Performs traversals of the graph which are documented in the PDF file
that Graph-Traversal generates.  Should be tested for memory leaks.  Appears to work.  May need reactoring. See Graph.txt, Graph2.txt 
and Graph3.txt to understand format of graph data the program expects.  Note that  if a line is read through standard input whose first
"word" is q standard input is closed, otherwise input will continue being read until such a line or eof occurs.
